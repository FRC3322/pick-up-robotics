# Objective

Be the first alliance to put all its balls into the goal. There are
no points scored, only a winner. If time runs out, the winner is the
alliance with fewest balls remaining.

# Alliances

A match is played between 2, 3 or 4 opposing alliances of up to 3
teams each. Alliances should have the same number of robots. An alliance
may have up to 2 human drivers for each robot and any number of
human players. The total number of humans on the largest alliance
must not exceed the smallest alliance by more than one person.

# Field

The field requires a flat, open area at least 50 feet by 50 feet. The
surface may vary; a paved parking lot or basketball court are recommended.
Grass, dirt or slippery surfaces may limit the teams willing and able
to play.

The area of play for the robots is within a circle 100 feet in
circumference. At the center of the circle is the goal, a weighted
rubber garbage can with an open top. The circle is divided into equal
size sectors, one for each alliance.

The area of play for humans is outside a concentric circle 125 feet in
circumference. The gap between the two circles is a safety zone that
may not be entered by robots or humans.

It is not critical that the circles are perfectly shaped or the goal
is in the exact center. The field must be marked in chalk, paint, tape,
electrical extension cords, garden hoses or some other easily visible
material less than 1" high. All teams must agree to the field.

# Game Pieces

Each alliance has three flags and three balls.

A flag is a cube or regular tetrahedron with 8 inch edges. It must
be an open lattice formed by smooth plastic tubing 1" to 2" in
diameter. Vision tracking aids such as paint or tape may coat the tubing.

A ball is a size 3 or size 1 soccer ball or similar substitute. It
must be inflated to a normal pressure. All balls must be marked to
show the owning alliance.

# Time

Matches are variable duration. The recommended maximum length is
150 seconds, however teams may agree to longer or unlimited duration.
A match begins with 15 seconds of auton play followed by teleop play.

# Starting Positions

Robots begin play within their alliance's sector and touching the
circle. Flags begin play also within the sector, but touching the goal
or another flag. Balls start in the human area, but enter play during
teleop.

# Auton Play

Alliances attempt to clear all flags from their sectors. Immediately
upon clearing all flags from its sector, an alliance's ball is removed
as if it had been put into the goal. Drivers may not control robots
during auton.

# Teleop Play

Alliances attempt to clear all flags from their sectors and put balls
into the goal. When all flags are clear from its sector, an alliance's
ball may enter play. Human players can throw or bounce the ball into
the goal, or give it to a robot or to another human player. Robots may
use any technique to put the ball into the goal.

Once a ball is in play, it remains in play until put into the goal.
An alliance may have only one ball in play at a time. An alliance is
not allowed to control the ball of another alliance.

A robot may not control both a flag and a ball at the same time.

Robots and humans may go anywhere in their respective areas. Defensive
play is permitted, but contact with an opposing alliance's ball is
restricted to passive deflections.

# Clearing Flags

A flag counts as being cleared from a sector if it is being carried
clear of the ground or if it is completely outside the sector and
still within the robot playing area. A robot causing a flag to leave
the robot playing area is treated as having a flag in their sector
until the flag is returned to play.

A flag that leaves the robot playing area must be returned to play
near the point it exited play by a human player on the alliance that
caused the flag to exit play.

# General Rules and Safety

* Robots must not enter the safety zone.
* Humans must not enter the safety zone except to briefly retrieve a ball or flag.
* A human may not contact another human.
* Balls and flags may not be used to harm or knock over a human.
* A robot may not intentionally damage or knock over another robot.
* Balls and flags may not be used to intentionally damage or knock over a robot or goal.
* Flags must not be put in the goal.
* Robots must not move the goal.
* Flags must be returned to play immediately; Human players returning a flag have right of way.
* Only drivers may control a robot.

An alliance breaking a rule receives a time penalty or ball adjustment
depending on the severity of the offense.
