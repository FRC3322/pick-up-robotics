# Washtenaw Pick-Up Robotics - WAPUR

Right now this is just an idea. Ken has written down some of his thoughts,
but the project depends on what we want to do and what we're willing to work
towards. Imagine a small group of students spending four team saturdays and a
bunch of their own evenings building a robot so they can play pick-up games
in a Washtenaw league.

# Next Steps

- Write robot rules (based on FRC with restrictions added)
- Write build and mentoring restrictions (based on OCCRA)
- Write "spirit of the game" rules (based on Ultimate's self referring)
- Develop the game itself
- Play test and iterate
- Outline a fall program built around pick-up robotics

# Background

Why build a fall program around a game?
- Many reasons: it's more fun; it's more engaging; it emphasizes
  skills needed during the FRC season; it reduces mentor time creating
  lab exercises; it creates structure to help new students and
  mentors join the team.

Why not just adopt the OCCRA game?
- Oakland county and VEX puts a tremendous amount of mentor effort into
  designing a new game each year. They've offered to share the game
  with us. However, it also takes a lot of effort and coordination
  to run the competitions (they are similar to FRC district events).
  Mentor burn-out during the FRC season is a problem and spending
  a large amount of time organizing competitions seems like it would
  make the problem worse.
